# Random Recipe Generator üçî
* As a user I want to generate random recipes on the click of a button.
* As a user I want to be able to choose a new random recipe.
* As a user I want to see a video of how to cook the recipe, if I so choose.
* As a user I want to save recipes to local storage so that I can access them later.
